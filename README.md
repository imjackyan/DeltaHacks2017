# TrustyNews

##Description
The purpose of TrustyNews is to have a way to systematically and accurately identify whether a given article is fake news or real news. 
The site uses three different techniques to accomplish this:
- Sentiment and Emotion analysis powered by IBM Watson
- Number of search results in Google News and identifying their reliabilities
- A hard coded database of fake and real news domains.

The site then reports a percentage reliability to the user by weighting these three techniques.

TrustyNews is a website written in Python with Django back end and HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript for front end.
